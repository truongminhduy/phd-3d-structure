# DQNM expansion in 3D

*Application of DQNM expansion of electromagnetic fields in the 3D structure for both bounded and unbounded cases.*

*Python and C++(for getdp and gmsh) codes that reproduces the numerical results in the PhD manuscript [arXiv:2009.01307](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01307)*

## Instruction

1. Install getdp and gmsh and update the path leading to getdp and gmsh in the main files.
2. Run 2 main files "main_3D_sphere.py" and "main_3D_PML.py"  in order to obtain data.
3. Run 2 files "plot_E.py", "plot_E_PML.py", to plot the figures from data.
